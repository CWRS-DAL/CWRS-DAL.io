<p><font>This model generates lead solubility predictions using the LEADSOL (@schock1996) and minteq.v4 (@charlton2011; @parkhurst2013) databases. Lead binding to humic substances is modeled using an approximation to the Windermere Humic Aqueous Model (@tipping1992; see pbcusol::eq_sol_wham()). Lead concentration is shown as a function of stagnation time inside a lead pipe using a model described by Kuch and Wagner (@kuch1983).</p>
